Overview
---
In my last post in this series, I talked about exploiting stack buffer overflows. I highly recommend walking through that [post](https://jb05s.github.io/HEVD-Driver-Exploitation-Part-2-Stack-Overflow-Presented-in-Python-and-C/) to get comfortable with performing driver analysis, if this is your first time attacking Windows kernel drivers.

In this post, I'd like to talk about another vulnerability HackSys implemented into their driver - Arbitrary Memory Overwrite.
