Overview
---
In this blog series, I'm going to provide an introduction to analyzing and exploiting a vulnerable driver on Windows. While there are many blogs already available on the topics I'm about to cover, this is an opportunity for me to reinforce my understanding of driver exploitation. 

Additionally, since I'm on my journey of learning C, I will not only be writing my exploits in Python, but also in C!

In this part, I'm going to cover the setting up of the test environment. While this may not be the most fun, it's a crucial part. If this your first time performing this process, this should help you out. I remember my first time going through the process of setting up the test environment and had to refer to a few online articles. So, hopefully this will be your one-stop shop!

Setting Up the Environment - Tools
---
First things first, we'll have to setup the test environment for kernel debugging. 

Here's what you'll need, to follow along with the setup process:
1. Windows 7 32-bit virtual machine (VM)
2. [HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver v3.0](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/releases) (HEVD)
3. [WinDBG](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) (You'll only need to install 'Debugging Tools')
4. [IDA Freeware](https://samsclass.info/126/proj/idafree50.exe)
5. [OSRLOADER](http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5Earticle=157.htm) (Registering the vulnerable driver)
6. Text-Editor (I recommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3))
7. Lastly, [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [C](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) (or both!)

Setting Up the Environment - Debugger
---
Now that you've retrieved all the necessary tools listed above, let me provide some detail on how I go about setting up the environment. (I'm going to take on the assumption that you've already installed a fresh instance of Windows 7 x86 (whether it'd be on VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, etc.).

Let's called the installed Windows 7 x86 instance **'Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger'**.

Below are the list of steps I take in setting up the **'Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger'** machine:
1. First, let's install **'WinDBG - Debugging Tools'**
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/windbg-install.png" alt="">
	- To save time later, we'll setup the Debugging Symbols now by creating a System Variable
		- Go to Computer -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
		- Create a System Variable with the following:
			- Variable Name: **_NT_SYMBOL_PATH**
			- Variable Value: **SRV*C:\Symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols**
2. Next, we'll install **OSRLOADER** (We'll complete the driver registration process a bit later on)
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/osrloader-install.png" alt="">
3. After installing **OSRLOADER**, we'll proceed by installing **IDA Freeware**

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ida-install.png" alt="">
4. Following **IDA Freeware**, let's install **Python** and/or **Mingw-w64** for GCC (and add them to our **Environment Variables - 'Path'** for ease)
	- **C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\i686-8.1.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0\mingw32\bin**
	- **C:\Python27**

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/c_py-install.png" alt="">
5. Next, let's extract the **HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver** contents to the **Desktop**
	- Additionally, since this is the **Debugger** machine, let's save some time and headache by placing the 'HEVD.pdb' file in the following directory (So WinDGB can resolve the driver symbols)
		- For HEVD-v3.0 - **C:\projects\hevd\build\driver\vulnerable\x86\HEVD\HEVD.pdb**
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hevd-pdb-path-dbgr.png" alt="">
6. Lastly, for the **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger** machine, install your favorite text editor.

Setting Up the Environment - Debuggee
---
Now with the **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger** machine setup up, let's **shutdown** the virtual machine and create a **Linked Clone** of the machine. Let's call this cloned VM **Windows 7 (x86) - Debuggee**

This can be done by right-clicking on the **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger** machine under your **'VMware - Library'** -> **Manage** -> **Clone** -> **Create a linked clone**

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vm-linked-clone.png" alt="">

Now that we've successfully cloned **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger** as **Windows 7 (x86) - Debuggee**, there's very little we'll have to do in terms of setup. 

Below is a list of steps we'll have to do on the **Windows 7 (x86) - Debuggee** machine:
1. Using **BCD**, we'll enable debugging
	- Run **CMD** as Administrator, and execute the following commands:
		- bcdedit /copy {current} /d "Debug"
		- bcdedit /debug {<String output from previous command>} on
		- bcdedit /dbgsettings
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bcdedit-cmds.png" alt="">
2. Lastly, we'll need to register and start the **HEVD** driver using **OSRLOADER**
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/osrloader-hevd.png" alt="">

We've now successfully completed the setup of the **Windows 7 (x86) - Debuggee** machine!

Setting Up the Environment - Communication Between Debugger and Debuggee
---
With everything we need installed/configured on the two machines, we now have to add/modify some settings in both of the VMware Virtual Machine Configuration (.VMX) files. Since our environment is on Windows 7, and communication over a Network connection isn't supported, we'll need to add a Serial Port to each of the machines, in order for them to interact with one another.

For the Debugger machine, add the following to the .VMX file:
1. serial0.present = "TRUE"
2. serial0.fileType = "pipe"
3. serial0.fileName = "\\.\pipe\com_1"
4. serial0.pipe.endPoint = "server"

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/debugger-vmx.png" alt="">

For the Debuggee machine, add the following to the .VMX file:
1. serial0.present = "TRUE"
2. serial0.fileType = "pipe"
3. serial0.fileName = "\\.\pipe\com_1"
4. serial0.pipe.endPoint = "client"

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/debuggee-vmx.png" alt="">

After saving the changes made to the .VMX files, let's test to make sure our connection between the Debugger and Debuggee machines are good.

To do this, we first have to boot up the **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger** machine, and open **WinDBG**. From within WinDBG, we need to go to **File -> Kernel Debug.. -> COM** and verify that the **Baud Rate** value matches what's disclosed in the **bcdedit /dbgsettings** command we ran in the previous section, and that the **Port** value is set to **com1**. Click **OK** once you've verified the settings.

Now, with **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger** machine waiting for **Windows 7 (x86) - Debuggee** to connect, let's boot it up and select **"Debug"** from the **Windows Boot Manager** screen.
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/windows-boot-manager.png" alt="">

If you've managed to follow all the steps above correctly, when you switch back over to your **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger** machine running WinDBG, you should see that you've successfully made a connection to the **Windows 7 (x86) - Debuggee** machine!

Setting Up the Environment - Verifying Driver
---
With a successfully connection made between the debugger and debuggee, we'll do one last check to make sure that everything is configured properly, before moving forward.

Let's break into the debuggee from WinDBG (CTRL + Break) on **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger**, and verify that we see that the **HEVD** module has been loaded, and that its symbols have been successfully mapped.
This can be done by running the following commands within WinDBG:
1. _lm m H* (Query the loaded modules that begin with the letter 'H')_
2. _x /D HEVD!a* (Query the list of functions within the 'HEVD' module that begin with the letter 'A')_
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/enum-hevd-windbg.png" alt="">

_If you were not successful in enumerating HEVD , check to see if you successfully registered and started the HEVD service via OSRLOADER on **Windows 7 (x86) - Debuggee**. If you cannot enumerate the HEVD functions, check to make sure that the HEVD.pdb file is in the correct directory on **Windows 7 (x86) - Debugger**_

If you've made it this far, and have successfully confirmed everything up to this point, AWESOME!!

We can now move onto the fun stuff!
